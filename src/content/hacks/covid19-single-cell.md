## Background

The COVID-19 pandemic generated an unprecedented amount of single-cell RNA-seq data from infected patients. However, these datasets were scattered across different studies and platforms, making it difficult to identify common patterns and therapeutic targets.

## Why it mattered

By integrating these datasets, we were able to identify consistent cellular responses across different patient populations, providing valuable insights for understanding disease mechanisms and developing targeted therapies.
