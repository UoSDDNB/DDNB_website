abstract: "We present a novel computational framework for integrating single-cell and bulk RNA-seq data to identify cellular heterogeneity in cancer. Our approach reveals previously unknown cell subpopulations and provides insights into tumor progression mechanisms."

This study demonstrates how integrative analysis of single-cell and bulk RNA-seq data can reveal cellular heterogeneity that would be missed by either approach alone. We developed a novel computational framework that leverages the strengths of both data types to provide a more complete picture of cellular diversity in cancer.
