bioLong: "I'm a PhD student in the Data-Driven Network Biology Group at the University of Southampton. My work combines biology and machine learning. My aim is to develop generative and interpretable models to explore single-cell transcriptomic data. I'm particularly interested in how we can use these models to reveal the features that drive cellular diversity, and to generate novel digital representations of human cells."
