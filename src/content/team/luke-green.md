bioLong: "I'm a PhD student and computational biologist working at the interface of network biology, single-cell transcriptomics, and machine learning. My current research focuses on foundation models for single-cell data, with an emphasis on rigorous benchmarking and clinical relevance. By integrating DNA sequence data with scRNA-seq, I aim to improve our understanding of cancer and rare genetic disorders, better informing diagnosis and treatment options."
