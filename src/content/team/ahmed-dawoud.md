bioLong: "Dr. Ahmed Dawoud is a research fellow in computational biology with a strong background in genetics and bioinformatics. He previously worked at University Hospital Southampton NHS Trust as a senior bioinformatician. Ahmed has a proven track record in studying age-related clonal haematopoiesis, a pre-malignant state linked to increased risk of blood cancers and non-malignant diseases. He earned his PhD at the University of Southampton under the supervision of Prof. Nick Cross and Dr. William Tapper, focusing on large-scale genetic datasets such as the UK Biobank. His work spans statistical genetics, population-scale genomics, and translational bioinformatics."
