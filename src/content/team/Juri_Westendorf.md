bioLong: "Juri graduated from the University of Aberdeen in 2023 where in his thesis he looked at the impact of maternal immune activation on foetal brain development. In the same lab, he followed up, looking at the effects of the IL-17A signalling cascade on premature neurogenesis and excessive cortical folding. These have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, in particular to autism spectrum disorder. Having started his PhD in Dr Owen Rackham's lab for data-driven biology in October 2024, he is now using computational approaches to identify sequence determinants of translational efficiency across human tissues. His work integrates state-of-the-art genomic foundation models including Helix-mRNA and RNA-Genesis with ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing data to predict cell-type-specific translation rates. The project aims to develop deep learning pipelines for rational mRNA design, with experimental validation planned in collaboration with Mark Smales' lab at the University of Kent using massively parallel reporter assays"

Juri is a PhD student who investigates the mechanisms behind protein translation at the level of the ribosome. His aim is to combine sequence models with further modalities encoding RNA structure and cellular context information to ultimately generate mRNA sequences with context-controlled rates of translation.
