We develop deep learning approaches to analyze single-cell transcriptomic data, focusing on two key areas:

**T Cell Exhaustion & Immunotherapy**
Understanding T cell exhaustion mechanisms using machine learning to identify novel markers and transcription factors that may reverse exhaustion states. This work aims to improve cancer immunotherapy outcomes by differentiating treatment responders from non-responders in B cell lymphoma and other malignancies.

**Disease Trajectories & Cell State Transitions**
Building generative and interpretable models to explore how cells transition through disease states. By capturing the features that drive cellular diversity, we aim to identify disease-specific trajectories and potential intervention points for reversing pathological cell states.

This research combines cutting-edge single-cell sequencing with foundation models to reveal actionable biological insights.
