We leverage state-of-the-art sequence models to understand how mRNA sequences control protein translation rates across different cellular contexts.

**Sequence Determinants of Translation**
Integrating genomic foundation models like Helix-mRNA and RNA-Genesis with ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing data to predict cell-type-specific translation rates. By identifying sequence features that drive translational efficiency, we aim to understand fundamental mechanisms of gene expression regulation.

**Rational mRNA Design**
Developing deep learning pipelines to design mRNA sequences with controlled translation properties. This has applications in mRNA therapeutics, where optimizing translation efficiency and stability is critical for drug efficacy.

**Multi-Modal Integration**
Combining sequence models with RNA structure predictions and cellular context information to generate mRNA sequences with context-controlled rates of translation. Experimental validation through massively parallel reporter assays ensures our computational predictions translate to biological reality.
