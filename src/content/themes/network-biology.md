We build and rigorously evaluate deep learning models that predict how cells respond to perturbations—whether genetic knockouts, overexpression, or drug treatments.

**Foundation Model Development & Benchmarking**
Integrating DNA sequence data with single-cell RNA-seq to create models that generalize across cell types and conditions. We emphasize rigorous benchmarking and clinical relevance, evaluating fairness and bias in single-cell foundation models to ensure equitable performance across diverse patient populations.

**Multi-Omics Integration**
Combining transcriptomic, epigenomic, and genomic data to characterize clonal expansion and understand how genetic variation influences cellular phenotypes. Our work connects computational predictions to experimental validation for translational impact.

**Applications in Disease**
Applying perturbation models to cancer biology, rare genetic disorders, and age-related conditions like clonal haematopoiesis to better inform diagnosis and therapeutic strategies.
